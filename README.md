# Home-project
A financial App that helps keep track of expenses and income

Here you can find full code of my first home project App - <b>Budget First</b>.

In that project I used SQLite with different filters of data sorting and show it up in RecycleView.

At main menu (main activity) User add some numbers, description of it and than choose what it whould be (+, -).
On bottom menu: User can delete all data from database or check all the operations in second menu (second activity).

In the second menu, User can check what operations were added at a certain point in time. 
He can choose the year, month, day or view all the data for all the time.
